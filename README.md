# MGO2PC Website Frontend

https://mgo2pc.com/

# Project Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cipherxof/mgo2pc-frontend.git
cd mgo2pc-frontend
npm i
npm run start
```

* Currently you need to create the missing language files for the project to compile.
* You will have to connect the backend API to the live mgo2pc website since the backend is private.
